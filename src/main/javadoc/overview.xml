	<title>WFS 2.0 (OGC 09-025r2/ISO 19142) Conformance Test Suite</title>
	<description>
	    This executable test suite (ETS) checks WFS 2.0 implementations for conformance
		with respect to OGC 09-025r2/ISO 19142 (Geographic information -- Web feature service)
		and related standards. Conformance testing is a kind of 'black box' testing that
		examines externally visible characteristics or behaviors of the SUT and is independent
		of any implementation details. The test run arguments are summarized in the following table. 
		The obligation descriptor can have the following values: M (mandatory), O (optional), or C
		(conditional).
